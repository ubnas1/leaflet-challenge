# leaflet-challenge

In this project I have visualised the earthquake data from USGS API.

I have created a base map layer using open street maps API.

I collected the data from USGS API using javascript D3 library.

Then I created markers and plotted them on the map using leaflet.

Marker sizes depend on the magnitude of the earthquake.

Marker color depends on the depth of the earthquake. The deeper the earthquake, the darker the color.

A laegend has also been added on screen to make it easy to understand the colors of markers.
